# Gift Wrapping 3D
 - Gift Wrapping 3D Algo Visualization in Unity. Created using Psudo Code Reference: https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Spring16/09.pdf Page 21-24
 Uses Gizmo to draw and visualize output.
 Uses a messy couroutine implementation for Algo step though.
 Note: 
 The outputs is using OnDrawGizmo - so make sure Gizmo is enabled on the unity Editor Scene/Game Window

 - Some triangles can be generated inside the convex hull, issue could be linked with #
